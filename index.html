        <p class="left-content-text"><strong>Optimus Prime</strong>, also known in Japan as
          <strong>Convoy</strong>,<span><sup>[a]</sup></span> is a fictional character and the
          protagonist of the <span>Transformers</span> franchise. The Transformers characters were developed for an
          American market
          after <span>Hasbro</span> representatives visited the 1983 Tokyo Toy Show.<span><sup>[3]</sup></span> The
          characters were modified and the coloring
          was changed; notably, Optimus Prime was colored red, chrome, and dark blue. The popularity of the Transformers
          toys resulted in comics, movies, and even a TV series.
          <br><br>
          In the Transformers mythology, Optimus Prime is a Cybertronian, an extraterrestrial species of sentient
          self-configuring modular <span>robotic</span> lifeforms (e.g.: cars and other objects), a blend of biological
          evolution and
          technological engineering. In almost every version of the mythos, Optimus is the leader of the
          <span>Autobots</span> , a
          faction of Transformers who are rivals of another faction, the <span>Decepticons</span>. He is defined by his
          strong <span>moral character</span> and is almost always portrayed as the primary <span>hero</span> of the
          story, opposing the Decepticon leader
          <span>Megatron</span>.
          <br><br>
          Over the history of the Transformers franchise, Optimus Prime has been portrayed by a variety of actors such
          as <span>Peter Cullen, Garry Chalk, Neil Kaplan, David Kaye,</span> and <span>Alan Tudyk</span>.

            Optimus Prime, also known as Orion Pax, embodies strong moral values, exceptional leadership, and strategic
            prowess. Equipped with advanced weaponry and martial arts skills, he champions justice and peaceful
            coexistence with humans. As bearer of the matrix of Leadership, he leads the Autobots, engaged in an eternal
            conflict against the Decepticons. <br><br> Originating from the ancient Dynasty of Primes, Optimus Prime's
            selfless
            sacrifice and rallying cry of "All are One" were pivotal in defeating Unicron. Reborn as Orion Pax, he
            embraced his new identity, only to reclaim his role as Optimus Prime to confront the Decepticons led by his
            former friend, Megatron, igniting the Great War on Cybertron. While his origins and persona may vary across
            different storylines, this depiction remains consistent throughout iterations of the Transformers universe.
